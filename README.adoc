= Demo POC

== How to run

Just run `com.redhat.summit2019.optaplanner.app.TravelingMechanicApp`.

== Notes

* Input/output is currently in XStream XML, but it needs to switch to a less verbose format (JSON, txt, binary, ...).
* The UI is currently in Swing and ugly, but it needs to be replaced by a pretty web UI in the dashboard.
